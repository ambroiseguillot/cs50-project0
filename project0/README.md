## Objectives
The website runs without a dedicated Flask or Jango server. 

Html pages: the website contains 5 pages that are all accessible via links and buttons. 
* About.html: brief description of what the site is about
* Index.html: home page with points the visitor to all 3 content pages listed next. Uses the Bootstrap Card and Button components
* North.html: Uses the Bootstrap Button and Carousel components 
* South.html: Uses the Bootstrap Button and Carousel components
* Food.html: Uses the Bootstrap Carousel and Table components

Stylesheets: in addition to the Bootstrap stylesheet, the website uses one static stylesheet and one scss-generated stylesheet. 
* nz-site.css: static css file where we use a few methods to style our website: we use the Element selector, ID selector, Attribute selector, Descendant combinator, Class selector. 
* compiled-styles.css: I have used Koala to recompile the 'compiled-styles.scss' file automatically. The scss file makes use of variables, nesting and inheritance as required.
